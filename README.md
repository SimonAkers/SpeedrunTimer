# SpeedrunTimer
A simple plugin for timing Rocket League training pack speed runs.

The timer is visible in the top left corner of the screen.
The timer is automatically started upon beginning a training pack and is automatically stopped when the training pack is completed.
The time per shot is also logged when the shot replay begins.
